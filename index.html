        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen
        book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more
        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
        literature
        from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
        Virginia,
        looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
        cites of
        the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
        1.10.33
        of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
        treatise
        on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
        sit
        amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
